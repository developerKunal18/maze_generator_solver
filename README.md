# maze_generator_solver
This project generates a random maze using Depth-First Search (DFS) and then solves it automatically using a pathfinding algorithm. It visualizes the maze in the terminal using ASCII symbols — or optionally with matplotlib if you want a graphical view.  It’s a cool mix of recursion, algorithms, and logic — and it looks awesome when running!
