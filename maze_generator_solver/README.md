# 🌀 Maze Generator & Solver – Python Project 

## 💡 Overview
The **Maze Generator & Solver** is a Python project that automatically **creates** and **solves** mazes using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm.  
It visualizes the maze right in your terminal using ASCII characters — and you can watch the solver explore paths in real-time! ⚙️  

This project is a fun way to learn about **recursion**, **backtracking**, and **pathfinding algorithms** in Python. 🧩
